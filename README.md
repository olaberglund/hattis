# hattis

**H**askell solutions to K**attis** problems.

I use Brent Yorgey's [list of solved kattis problems](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/kattis.html) to pick challenges of increasing difficulty, and varying "grade".
Table of solved problems:

| Problem | Link                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Tildes  | [Tildes](./app/Tildes.hs) |
